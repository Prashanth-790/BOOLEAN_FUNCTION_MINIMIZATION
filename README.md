### EXPERMENT 2:  IMPLEMENTATION OF BOOLEAN FUNCTION MINIMIZATION

### AIM:

To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D 

F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy

### EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

Software – Quartus prime:

### THEORY:

Boolean function minimization is a process to simplify a Boolean expression without altering its functionality. The goal is to reduce the number of literals, terms, and gates in a logic circuit, leading to cost-effective, efficient, and easier-to-implement designs.

### PROCEDURE:

1.	Type the program in Quartus software.

2.	Compile and run the program.

3.	Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.

4.	Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.

5.	For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
